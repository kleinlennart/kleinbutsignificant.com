-   **WhatsApp Text Analysis** üí¨  
    As WhatsApp lets you export any chat to a .txt file, I am working on a [Shinyapp](https://shiny.rstudio.com) to create an interactive, insightful, and funny analysis dashboard for any given group chat history.

-   **{RoamR} Package** üì¶  
    The developer team of my note-taking app [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) is currently [working on an API](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1220174709792227328) Endpoint. üéâ  
    As soon as it is released, I want to do some data science analyses on my "Second Brain" with \#rstats (e.g., centrality measures of the knowledge graph, etc.) and make it into an R package.

-   **Roam to Anki Integration** üóÇ  
    In my Roam Graph, I have a German and English wordbook page in which I copy all the words I come across during the day that I don't know.  
    I want to learn these words with my flashcard tool [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), so I am working on an App that takes recently added words from Roam and parses them to cards in my Anki deck with a definition from a dictionary's API.

-   **Twitter API v2 in R Templates** ‚¨áÔ∏è  
    Twitter has just released v2 of their [API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access), but the [code examples on GitHub](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/) are still relatively limited in volume and function ([especially for R](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/search?l=R)).   
    That's why I began writing some API wrapper functions in R for the major API endpoints and plan to make an explanatory GitHub repo or another package out of it.
