### Lennart Klein


👨🏼‍🎓I'm a **Political Science**, **Sociology**, and **Psychology** student at the **University of Tübingen** (Germany) with a particular interest in the intersection of these fields and, more specifically, political psychology, disinformation and populism, social media research, and system change management.🌱

 👨🏽‍💻I currently work as a research assistant at the **Hector Research Institute** (HIB) with [Prof. Dr. Christian Fischer](http://chrisfi.com), [Conrad Borchers](https://cborchers.com) and [many others](http://chrisfi.com/team).  
My primary focus is data mining (Twitter API / Webscraping), data wrangling, management, and data visualization in R and Python. But, I have also worked on ethics in social media research and privacy.


📚💭 In addition, I am interested in knowledge management systems like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) and the larger "Second Brain" idea, [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) and [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).
